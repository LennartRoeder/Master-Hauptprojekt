	abstract = {With the fast development of remote sensor technologies, e.g. the appearance of Very High Resolution (VHR) optical sensors, SAR, LiDAR, etc., mounted on either airborne or spaceborne platforms, multi-source remote sensing data fusion techniques are emerging due to the demand for new methods and algorithms. The general fusion techniques have been well developed and applied in various fields ranging from satellite earth observation to computer vision, medical image processing, defence security and so on. Despite the fast development, the techniques remain challenging for multi-source data fusion within varying spatial and temporal resolutions. This article reviews current techniques of multi-source remote sensing data fusion and discusses their future trends and challenges through the concept of hierarchical classification, i.e., pixel/data level, feature level and decision level. This article concentrates on discussing optical panchro-matic and multi-spectral data fusing methods. So far, the pixel level fusion methods have mainly focused on optical data fusion; high-level fusion includes feature level and decision level fusion of multi-source data, such as synthetic aperture radar, optical images, LiDAR and other types of data. Finally, this article summarises several trends tending to broaden the application of multi-source data fusion. 1. Introduction Data fusion, as a general and popular multi-discipline approach, combines data from multiple sources to improve the potential values and interpretation performances of the source data, and to produce a high-quality visible representation of the data. Fusion techniques are useful for a variety of applications, ranging from object detection, recognition, identification and classification, to object tracking, change detection, decision making, etc. It has been successfully applied in the space and earth observation domains, computer vision, medical image analysis and defence security, etc. Remote sensing data fusion, as one of the most commonly used techniques, aims to integrate the information acquired with different spatial and spectral resolutions from sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft and ground platforms to produce fused data that contains more detailed information than each of the sources. Research on data fusion has a long history in the remote sensing community because fusion products are the basis for many applications. Researchers and practitioners have},
