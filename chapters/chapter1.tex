\chapter{Introduction}
To function, the MARS LIFE simulation system relies on input data that influences the simulation runs. Due to to environmental domain, the use of so called GIS data is essential. The current implementation for GIS is not usable from a performance standpoint. This work analyses the current state and itroduces architectual changes to solve this problem of slow GIS reads.
