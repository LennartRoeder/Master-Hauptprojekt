\chapter{Analysis}
The goal of this work is to create a layer inside the simulation system MARS LIFE that allows loading geospatial data in an high-performance way. To ensure the practical use to the model developers, use-cases were taken into account to generate requirements for the implementation.



\section{Use-Cases}
\begin{usecase}
	\addtitle{Vector I}{Open Vector file for reading}
	\addfield{Summary:}{Open a Vector file that was imported prior to the simulation creation.}
	\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{
		\item The vector file was imported and mapped prior to the simulation run.
		\item The Shapefile is valid (containing at least a .shp, .shx and .dbf file).
	}
	\additemizedfield{Primary Scenario:}{
		\item Initiate a vector GIS layer inside the model from a file and enable agents the underlying Shapefile.
	}
