\chapter{Analysis}
The goal of this work is to create a layer inside the simulation system MARS LIFE that allows loading GIS in an high-performance way. To ensure the practical use to the model developers use-cases were taken into account to generate requirements for the implementation.



\section{Use-Cases}
\begin{usecase}
	\addtitle{Vector I}{Read all features}
	\addfield{Summary:}{Read features from vector files with the following types: 
		\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-.25em]
			\item Point
			\item Polyline
			\item Polygon
		\end{itemize}
	}
	\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{
		\item The vector file was imported prior to the simulation run.
	}
	\additemizedfield{Primary Scenario:}{
		\item A layer wants to read the position of agents during the initialization.
	}
%	\additemizedfield{Alternative Scenario:}{
%		\item The user clicks the upload button, browses files of his local machine, fills the form for every file and starts the import.
%	}
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}
	\addtitle{Vector II}{Read feature at position}
	\addfield{Summary:}{Read the closest feature to a GPS position.
	}
	\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{
		\item The vector file was imported prior to the simulation run.
	}
	\additemizedfield{Primary Scenario:}{
		\item An agent wants to find a point of interest in his area (e.g. An elephant looking for the closest waterhole).
	}
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}
	\addtitle{Vector III}{Calculate distance between features}
	\addfield{Summary:}{A function that takes two features of different types as input and returns the distance in meters.
	}
	\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{
		\item Both features exist and are available to the layer.
	}
	\additemizedfield{Primary Scenario:}{
		\item An agent wants to know the distance to a specific pint of interest.
	}
\end{usecase}

\section{Requirements}


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\reqstartF
	\item Point and area
	\item GPS position
	\item Determine distance to a feature (POI)
	\item Check if position overlaps with a polygon
	\item Follow polygon (e.g. rivers)
